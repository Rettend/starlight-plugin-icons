# TODO

docs:

- fix relative links in mdx files, maybe docs.rettend.me router too
- clarify that `extractSafelist: true` only looks at 'astro.config.mjs' etc for icons, maybe a config for this? or just point user to configure unocss `content` instead
- troubleshooting page: clarify that when the safelist is correctly generated, the plugin's job is done, and from there it's an unocss issue. check the generated css files in dist for icon classes
- configuration page: explain what each config does exactly
- manual setup: no Icons(), use each piece separately
