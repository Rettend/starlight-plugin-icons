# starlight-plugin-icons

Add icons to Astro Starlight: sidebar, codeblocks, file tree

TODO:

- for sidebar, either set extractSafelist: true, or configure unocss content.pipeline and filesystem
- no you don't need to commit the safelist for cloudflare, there is an issue: newly generated safelists are not loaded. (current unocss dep tech is nice try but doesn't work)
- delete quick start, only sidebar and codeblocks guides
