Missing icons

- Ensure UnoCSS is installed and enabled.
- Verify the icon class exists (e.g. `i-ph:*`, `i-material-icon-theme:*`).

Safelist not applied

- Check `.starlight-icons/safelist.json` exists after dev/build.
- Set `SPI_SAFELIST_PATH` to a custom safelist if your content folder is nonstandard.

Network fetch errors

- The plugin downloads Material Icons metadata on first run. If offline, it falls back without icons.
