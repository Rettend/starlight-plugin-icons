#### Missing icons

- Verify the icon collections are installed.
- Ensure UnoCSS is installed with the correct presets. It's recommended to also use `presetWind3()`
- Verify that icons have non-zero `width` and `height` or `font-size`.
- Check that you are using the correct icon class syntax: `i-{collection}:{icon}`.

<Aside type="caution">
  Other icon class syntaxes are not supported currently.
</Aside>

#### Safelist not applied

- Check `.starlight-icons/safelist.json` exists after dev/build and contains the correct icons.
- Set `SPI_SAFELIST_PATH` to a custom safelist if your content folder is nonstandard.

#### Network fetch errors

- The plugin downloads Material Icons metadata on first run.

#### Sidebar icons not working on Cloudflare

I'm not sure what the issue is, but Cloudflare Workers don't load the newly generated safelist during deployment build.

The fix is to commit the safelist to the repo:

```txt title=".gitignore"
.starlight-icons/*
!.starlight-icons/safelist.json
```
