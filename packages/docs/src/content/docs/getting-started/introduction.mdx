description: What starlight-plugin-icons adds to your Starlight docs site.
---

`starlight-plugin-icons` enhances Starlight in 2 places:

- Sidebar entries: add an `icon` field to items in your sidebar config.
- Code blocks: shows a matching Material Icon based on language or `title`.

It also ships:

- An improved `<FileTree>` component that renders folder/file icons automatically based on their names.
- Improved `<Card>` and `<Aside>` components that can be used with any icon.
- An `<IconLink>` component that renders a link card with an icon.

Continue with [Installation](../installation), then [Quick Start](../quick-start).
