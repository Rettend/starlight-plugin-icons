title: Code Block Icons
description: Automatic Material Icons for code blocks.

How it works

- An Expressive Code hook inspects code blocks.
- If the block has a `title` (e.g. `title="app.ts"`) or a known `language`, the plugin resolves a Material Icon and prepends it to the caption.

Usage

```ts title="example.mdx"
```ts title="app.ts"
console.log('hi')
```
```

Notes

- The CSS for spacing is included via `starlight-plugin-icons/styles/main.css` when the plugin is enabled.
- You can disable all codeblock features by setting `codeblock: false` in options.
