title: Safelist & Caching
description: How the Material Icons safelist is generated and consumed.
---

##### Generation

During dev/build, the integration scans

- `astro.config.mjs` for icon classes
- `src/content/**/*.mdx?` for:
  - Code block titles and languages
  - `<FileTree>` entries

It writes `.starlight-icons/safelist.json` in your project root.

##### Usage

- The UnoCSS preset reads this safelist and adds classes to `safelist`.

##### Override path

- Set `SPI_SAFELIST_PATH` env var to a JSON file of classes to force a safelist.
