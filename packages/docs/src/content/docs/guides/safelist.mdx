title: Safelist & Caching
description: How the Material Icons safelist is generated and consumed.
---

Generation

- During dev/build, the integration scans `src/content/**/*.mdx?` for:
  - Code block titles and languages
  - `<FileTree>` entries
- It writes `.material-icons-cache/material-icons-safelist.json` in your project root.

Usage

- The UnoCSS preset reads this safelist automatically and adds classes to `safelist`.

Override path

- Set `SPI_SAFELIST_PATH` env var to a JSON file of classes to force a safelist.
